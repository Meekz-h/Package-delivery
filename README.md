# Truck delivery system

## Purpopse

Given a list of packages, we want to determine the shortest route for the trucks that the packages are loaded onto based on the addresses. 

## Implementation

The method used to find the shortest route was the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. After extracting package and address / distance data, the algorithm is used to determine what the next package should be. 

## Usage

To use the system, first run Main.py. The user interacts via the CLI using numbers as options. Other data could be loaded, given the distances and addresses are provided in the correct format (Following the CSV.)
